                Trim dark green top from leek; discard. Slice white and pale green parts ½" thick. Place in a large bowl, cover with water, and rinse, separating rings to remove dirt. Drain; pat dry.

                Heat oil in a large pot over medium. Cook half of the leek, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 2 minutes. Add garlic and ¼ cup curry paste. Cook, stirring occasionally to coat leek, until fragrant and curry is brick red, about 2 minutes. Add broth, tahini, honey, soy sauce, vinegar, and 2 cups water and stir to combine. Increase heat to high and bring liquid to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover pot, and simmer 20 minutes. Taste soup; stir in more curry paste and season with salt.
