            <li>
                Place bacon in a large, oven-proof skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until all the fat is rendered and the bacon is crispy and evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Remove bacon from the skillet and set aside. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Carefully pour out all the fat, except for 2 tablespoons.
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li>
                Pat chicken thighs dry, and lightly sprinkle both sides with salt and pepper to taste.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add sliced mushrooms to the skillet and cook until they are soft. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
            </li>

            <li>
                Place in the preheated oven and bake, uncovered, until internal temperature of chicken is 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 20 minutes.
            </li>

            <li>
                Combine cornstarch and cold water in a small bowl, stirring quickly, until all the lumps are gone. Stir into the sauce while it is still hot and allow the sauce to thicken slightly.
            </li>

            <li>
                Transfer chicken and sauce to a serving dish, crumble reserved bacon over all, and sprinkle with parsley.
            </li>

        </ol>
